## BOXES

<img width="867" alt="boxes" src="https://github.com/SergioTorresGarcia/RetoCSS/assets/90457425/8d4d41b4-8fbd-431c-add5-d0a13273bf5f">


<h2>Practical CSS exercise:</h2>

- Generate an html+css view with 10 different color boxes, all reactive to hover. No color repetition
- The project must be linked to a repository
- If able, divide the 10 boxes in 2 rows of 5.

<hr>

When hovering over the boxes, these change color, shape and/or size.
When clicking (and holding) on them, some would become smaller and black and others bigger and white.
